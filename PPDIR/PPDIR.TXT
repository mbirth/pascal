To install PPDir, just copy the executable PPDIR.EXE to a directory which is
in your path and run it there. It will extract itself into 3 parts:
    PUSHD.EXE
    POPD.EXE
and SWAPD.EXE

PUSHD    is used to save the current directory into the temporary buffer. The
         buffer-file is stored in the TEMP-directory so that it survives
         system reboots.

POPD     is used to change to the directory which is stored in the buffer. The
         buffer will be deleted after the chdir succeeds.

SWAPD    will save the current directory into the buffer and then switch to
         the directory which was in the buffer before. If you run SWAPD again
         you will have the same state as before the first run.


To see what's in the buffer, just type any parameter after any command. If you
use 'debug' as parameter (without quotation marks) you will get into the
debug-mode which will show things happening during the performance of the
commands.


Now have your phun!
